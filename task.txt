## REQUIRED API KEYS
The following API keys need to be added to the backend/.env file:

1. OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY - For weather data (https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. OPENAQ_API_KEY - For air quality data (https://openaq.org/)
3. OPENSENSEMAP_API_KEY - For IoT sensor data (https://opensensemap.org/)
4. OPENEI_SOLAR_API_KEY - For solar power calculations (https://openei.org/wiki/OpenEI:API)
5. GEMINI_API_KEY - For AI chatbot functionality (https://ai.google.dev/)

Note: All backend modules include fallback synthetic data generation, so the application will function with limited features even without API keys.

## NEXT PRIORITY TASKS
1. Complete Dashboard component to provide system overview
2. Implement MapView component showing all city infrastructure
3. Complete remaining frontend components in priority order: Weather, Air Quality, Sensors
4. Set up development environment for concurrent running of backend and frontend
5. Begin implementation of authentication system
